### Artificial Neural Networks

There are three tasks in this assignment;

- First task is about Activation Functions
- The second task is about Optimizers.
- The third task is about Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) usage.

### 1. Activation Functions

ANNs use the Activation Functions to perform complex computations in the hidden layers and then transfer the result to
the output layer. Activation Functions introduces non-linear properties in the neural network. Some popular activation
functions are Sigmoid, Softmax, Tanh, ReLU, Leaky ReLU, Parameterized ReLU, Exponential Linear Unit, Swish, Binary Step,
Linear Activation Function.

### 2. ANN Optimizers

Optimizers are methods used to determine the features of the neural networks such as weights and learning rate to reduce
the losses. Some popular optimizers are Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, AdaGrad
optimizers.

### 3. ANN Usage Demo

- Build a ANN based machine learning model for any problem (and dataset) you are interested in.
- Support your solution with plot(s) and model evaluation metrics.
- Use at least two different Activation Functions and two optimizers and compare results.
  Select and use the best model based on the results.

In this assignment, I used the iconic Iris dataset to classify the flowers into three different species, from UCI
Machine Learning Repository with sklearn datasets library.
